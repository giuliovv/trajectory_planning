# Trajectory Planning
Global trajectory planning for an autonomous vehicle



We choose Ferrari 'LaFerrari' as the car moving in the circuit. The most relevant parameter is the vehicle width (1.992 m), used to take the trajectory line sufficiently inside
the track bounds. We also set an extra sicurity margin e = 0.40 m, chosen thinking that the width of the rear wheel is equal to 345 mm.
